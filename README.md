ABSTRACT: 
    This study assessed the feasibility of using a Black Soldier Fly Larvae, Hermetia Illucens, in an automated setting to decompose organic wastes. The goal was to determine the optimal conditions for larvae to decompose organic waste under controlled environmental conditions. The proof-concept experiment was undertaken by developing an automated controlled biopod in Bulua Terminal, Cagayan De Oro City. The experimental research setting is to have both biopods, in which the Black Soldier Fly larvae are controlled in an automated environment (Automated Biopod). In the comparison (Manual Biopod), where there was a manual intervention for feeding the larvae in the biopod, the experimental research demonstrated that the (Automated Biopod) successfully monitored and fed the larvae as the substrate level exceeded its parameters. Key design parameters, including humidity and temperature, were investigated. These key parameters were then used to design a prototype biopod to control its temperature and humidity in a controlled environment ideal for Black Soldier larvae. An initial cost assessment was included to determine the planning of the prototype controlled environment for BSF, in addition to contributing to the waste problem in the Bulua Terminal, with the help of BSF waste decomposition abilities.
